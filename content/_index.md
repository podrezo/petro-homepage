Hi there! I'm Petro &ndash; a software developer from Mississauga, Canada {{< icons/canadian-maple-leaf-brands-solid-full >}} I've been doing software development as a career for over a decade. I've worked on software in many industries including education, transportation, manufacturing, and finance. I love to share things I learn so be sure to check out my various profiles and blog if you want to learn more.
