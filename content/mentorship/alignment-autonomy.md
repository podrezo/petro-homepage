This comic from [Spotify's Squad Framework](https://medium.com/pm101/spotify-squad-framework-part-i-8f74bcfcd761) (drawing by Henrik Kniberg) does a fantastic job of illustrating the concept of alignment and autonomy. The idea is that a team should be aligned on the "what" and "why" of a project, but should have autonomy over the "how". This is a concept that I think is very important to understand and is a great topic to discuss with a mentor.
