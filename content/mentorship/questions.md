## Sometimes not knowing the questions is not a problem

Before I get into the list of questions, I'd like to point out that a huge benefit of mentorship is finding **unknown unknowns**. That is, things that you didn't even know that you didn't know. So, while the questions below are great, don't feel like you need to have a list of questions prepared - sometimes the best questions are the ones that come up in the moment. However, going through a list like this can help surface those unknown unknowns or at least get you to start thinking more deeply about some particular subject that you had previously thought was simple and shallow.

## Great topics to discuss

The following are topics that I think are great to discuss with a mentor. They are not necessarily questions that you would ask directly, but rather topics that you might want to explore with your mentor.

* Negotiating salaries
* Roles and responsibilities
  * Software Architect
  * Engineering Manager (Leadeship)
  * Independent Contributor (IC)
* Career growth
  * Climbing the ladder (Intern/Junior/Intermediate/Senior/etc.)
* Company size and how it affects things (Small/Medium/Large orgs)
* Consulting companies versus Product companies
  * Consulting
    * Pros
      * More exposure to different technologies
      * Better job security than being an independent contractor
      * Being able to travel for work
    * Cons
      * Less control over the projects you work on
      * Less control over the technologies you work with
      * No feeling of ownership over the products you work on
      * Shallower understanding of technologies from moving around
      * Pays lower than product companies, typically
* Skills, programming langauges, and technologies
  * Old, legacy technology and its role and importance
* Working on a team
  * [Alignment & Autonomy](/mentorship/alignment-autonomy)
  * [What a team looks like (structure, roles, etc.)](/mentorship/team-structure)
* The "art" of software development
* Recruiters
  * How to deal with them
