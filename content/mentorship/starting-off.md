## Starting off with a mentor

Mentorship can take many forms and it is most valuable when expectations are correctly set between mentor and mentee. Here are some things to consider before starting a mentorship:

### Are you looking for a mentor or a coach?

In the journey of personal and professional growth, imagine a mentor as an experienced hiker who has traversed various trails. They guide you through the winding paths of your career, not by leading you step-by-step, but by sharing tales of their own hikes, helping you navigate your path. A coach, on the other hand, is like a hiking instructor, focused on teaching you specific skills - how to climb a steep slope or cross a river. They equip you with the tools and techniques for particular challenges on the trail. Remember, this journey, whether with a mentor or coach, is not a race to the summit but a hike to savor and learn from each step.

### Time & Place

Establishing a cadence that works for both parties is critical. I have two kids and a full-time job, so I can't be available at a moment's notice and I generally am unavailable during normal business hours. E-mail is the best way to reach me and I can usually respond within a day or two. I am generally avaialble for video calls in the evenings and in mornings or early afternoons on weekends. If you prefer to meet in person, I am open to that as well, but it would have to be scheduled in advance and would likely be on a weekend.

## Great questions & topics of discussion

Before I get into the list of questions, I'd like to point out that a huge benefit of mentorship is finding **unknown unknowns**. That is, things that you didn't even know that you didn't know. So, while the questions below are great, don't feel like you need to have a list of questions prepared - sometimes the best questions are the ones that come up in the moment. However, going through a list like this can help surface those unknown unknowns or at least get you to start thinking more deeply about some particular subject that you had previously thought was simple and shallow.

The following are topics that I think are great to discuss with a mentor. They are not necessarily questions that you would ask directly, but rather topics that you might want to explore with your mentor.

* Negotiating salaries
* Roles and responsibilities
  * Software Architect
  * Engineering Manager (Leadeship)
  * Independent Contributor (IC)
* Career growth
  * Climbing the ladder (Intern/Junior/Intermediate/Senior/etc.)
* Company size and how it affects things (Small/Medium/Large orgs)
* Consulting companies versus Product companies
  * Consulting
    * Pros
      * More exposure to different technologies
      * Better job security than being an independent contractor
      * Being able to travel for work
    * Cons
      * Less control over the projects you work on
      * Less control over the technologies you work with
      * No feeling of ownership over the products you work on
      * Shallower understanding of technologies from moving around
      * Pays lower than product companies, typically
* Skills, programming langauges, and technologies
  * Old, legacy technology and its role and importance
* Working on a team
  * [Alignment & Autonomy](/mentorship/alignment-autonomy)
  * [What a team looks like (structure, roles, etc.)](/mentorship/team-structure)
* The "art" of software development
* Recruiters
  * How to deal with them
  * What to watch out for
  * When it can be beneficial to use one
  * The concept of "signing fees"
* How to have effective "1 on 1"s with managers
* How to perform well in interviews

Additionally, here are some questions I sourced from U of T's mentorship program handbook:
