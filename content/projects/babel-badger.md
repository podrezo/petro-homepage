# Babel Badger

Babel Badger is a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) chat bot that can translate messages into English (other languages are not currently supported, but could be if requested). It is powered by AWS Lambda to handle the webhooks and send out API requests and translates using ChatGPT. Here's the [Github repo](https://github.com/podrezo/babel-badger).
