Here are some things to consider before starting a mentorship:</p><h2 id=are-you-looking-for-a-mentor-or-a-coach>Are you looking for a mentor or a coach?</h2><p>In the journey of personal and professional growth, imagine a mentor as an experienced hiker who has traversed various trails. They guide you through the winding paths of your career, not by leading you step-by-step, but by sharing tales of their own hikes, helping you navigate your path. A coach, on the other hand, is like a hiking instructor, focused on teaching you specific skills - how to climb a steep slope or cross a river. They equip you with the tools and techniques for particular challenges on the trail. Remember, this journey, whether with a mentor or coach, is not a race to the summit but a hike to savor and learn from each step.</p><h2 id=time--place>Time & Place</h2><p>Establishing a cadence that works for both parties is critical. I have two kids and a full-time job, so I can&rsquo;t be available at a moment&rsquo;s notice and I generally am unavailable during normal business hours. E-mail is the best way to reach me and I can usually respond within a day or two. I am generally avaialble for video calls in the evenings and in mornings or early afternoons on weekends. If you prefer to meet in person, I am open to that as well, but it would have to be scheduled in advance and would likely be on a weekend.</p></div></div><div class="row footer mt-5 mb-5"><div class="col-lg-12 text-right"><hr>&copy; 2024 Petro Podrezo</div></div></div></body></html>
